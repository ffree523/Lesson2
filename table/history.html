                    <p>In 1720, while sailing to Port Royal,
                        Jamaica aboard the HMS Dauntless, Governor Weatherby Swann, his daughter Elizabeth and crew
                        encounter a shipwreck and recover a boy, Will Turner. Elizabeth discovers a golden pirate
                        medallion around his neck and takes it. Eight years later, Captain James Norrington is promoted
                        to commodore and proposes to Elizabeth. Her corset makes her faint and fall into the sea,
                        causing the medallion to emit a pulse. Captain Jack Sparrow, having just arrived in Port Royal
                        to commandeer a ship, rescues Elizabeth. Norrington identifies Jack as a pirate, and a chase
                        ensues. </p>

                    <p>The wedding of Will Turner and Elizabeth Swann is halted when Lord Cutler Beckett,
                        chairman of the East India Trading Company, arrives with arrest warrants for them, and also for
                        Commodore James Norrington, who allowed Captain Jack Sparrow to escape. Norrington has resigned
                        and disappeared after losing the Navy's flagship, HMS Dauntless,
                        in a hurricane while pursuing Jack. Meanwhile, Jack is visited by Will's father,
                        Bootstrap Bill Turner, aboard the Black Pearl. Bootstrap is a crewman on the
                        Flying Dutchman, captained by Davy Jones. Jack previously bartered a deal with Jones to raise
                        the Pearl from the depths, and must now join the Dutchman's crew or be dragged to Davy Jones'
                        Locker by the Kraken. Meanwhile, Beckett promises to free Elizabeth if Will brings him Jack's
                        magical compass, which points to whatever the holder wants most. </p>

                    <p>To control the oceans, Lord Cutler Beckett executes anyone associated with piracy in Port Royal
                        and orders Davy Jones to destroy all pirate ships. Condemned prisoners sing "Hoist the Colours"
                        to compel the nine Pirate Lords to convene at Shipwreck Cove to hold the Brethren Court. Because
                        Pirate Lord Jack Sparrow never named a successor before being dragged to Davy Jones' Locker,
                        Hector Barbossa, Will Turner, Elizabeth Swann, Tia Dalma, and the surviving
                        crew of the Black Pearl plot to rescue Jack. In Singapore, the crew meet Pirate Lord Sao Feng,
                        who owns navigational charts to the Locker. Will secretly promises to give Jack to Feng
                        in return for the Pearl, intending to use it to rescue his father "Bootstrap Bill" Turner
                        from the Flying Dutchman.</p>

                        and brought to King Ferdinand of Spain, where he claims to be a crewmate of Juan Ponce de León,
                        who disappeared 200 years ago searching for the Fountain of Youth. Seventeen years after
                        the battle of Calypso's maelstrom,[N 1] after a failed attempt to rescue his first mate,
                        Joshamee Gibbs, from execution in London, Captain Jack Sparrow is brought before King George II.
                        The king asks Jack to guide an expedition to locate the Fountain of Youth,
                        before King Ferdinand and the Spanish Navy locate it. Captain Hector Barbossa, now a privateer,
                        and sporting a peg leg, is captaining the expedition,
                        though only requires Sao Feng’s navigational charts, rather than Jack.</p>
